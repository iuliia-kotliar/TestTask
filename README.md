# API assessment
App was implemented using Visual Studio EE 2017 with .NET Framework 4.7.2.

Tests were run using ReSharper, but can also be run with the MSTest.

Pakages are added to the repository for convenience, but can be skipped and then need NuGetPackage restore. In case there is an error with NuGet package restore, make sure that SolutionDir in the .csproj is pointing to the right direcotry
